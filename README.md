# Linked Lists Exercise

This repo contains my answers to Springboard exercise 47.4.12.

I was tasked with taking a linked list, and implementing various instance methods on it. These methods include: inserting into the list, removing from the list, removing/appending to the end/beginning of the list, etc.

# Testing

First run:

```bash
npm i
```

Then run:

```bash
jest linked-list.test.js
```
